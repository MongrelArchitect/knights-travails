# Knights Travails

A program for determining the shortest possible path between two
squares for a knight on a standard 8 x 8 chessboard. There may be 
multiple paths of the same length. Here we construct a graph of all
possible moves and utilize a queue-based, breadth-first approach to find 
one such path.

Following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails).
